# R_programming_project_on_Diamonds
Data analysis on 'diamonds' dataset in R programming language along with Visualization 

This project was done as a part of course R Programming (course code: UE19CS208C) by A R MANYATHA - PES2UG19CS002, DEEPALI SURAJ ATTAVAR - PES2UG19CS106, MANASA K RAYACHOTI - PES2UG19CS215, ANANYA MUNGARA - PES2UG19CS040. We chose this dataset from the Internet includes a wide range of approximately 400 different diamonds along with their properties which include carat, colour, clarity, depth, pricing per carat and finally the total price.  A wide collection of tests and studies have been done on the dataset chosen. We have pictorially depicted the data for easier understanding using pie charts, line, scatter and bar graphs using basic functions of R and GGPLOT. We have found out the required results and the mean price per carat diamonds by applying statistics and verified the hypothesis testing using qqnorm and mean.
